# Joe's Reading Notes  
### About Me  
Hey! My name is Joe but my friends call me Jow. The nickname came about in early high school when someone misspelled my name in a Christmas card. I am a rapper and producer who's trying to get an actual job now so I'm getting into coding!

Besides rapping, I also listen to a lot of music. My top 3 genres are:
1. Metal (Especially black metal)
2. Rap (Especially cloud rap)
3. Rock (Especially grunge and garage rock)  

My music isn't really business friendly, but I'll link the new website of my favourite band that's reforming later this year after splitting in 1998:  
[Jesus Loves Junkies Official Page](https://www.jesuslovesjunkies.com/)  
Come to think of it they're not very safe for work either but I just wanted to test out the link feature. ~~Maybe if I become good enough at this I can make them a half-decent website.~~
