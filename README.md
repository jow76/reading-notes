# Joe's Reading Notes  
### About Me  
Hey! My name is Joe but my friends call me Jow. The nickname came about in early high school when someone misspelled my name in a Christmas card. I am a casual rapper and producer who's trying to get an actual job now so I'm getting into coding!

Besides rapping, I also listen to a lot of music. My top 3 genres are:
1. Metal (Especially black metal)
2. Rap (Especially cloud rap)
3. Rock (Especially grunge and garage rock)  

I also play a lot of video games - too many to list - but for the past year I've spent a lot of time playing The Elder Scrolls Online.

### Growth Mindset  
Having a growth mindset is very important when devloping skills and learning new things. Those with growth mindsets see challenges as opportunities and react positively to failures. I can keep myself in a growth mindset by:
1. Seeing failure not as the end but as one step closer to success
2. Staying positive and remembering I'm here to learn something new, so I'm likely to get confused sometimes
3. Looking back on how far I've already come from before the bootcamp
