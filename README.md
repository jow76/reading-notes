# Joe's Reading Notes  
### About Me  
Hey! My name is Joe but my friends call me Jow. The nickname came about in early high school when someone misspelled my name in a Christmas card. I am a casual rapper and producer who's trying to get an actual job now so I'm getting into coding!

Besides rapping, I also listen to a lot of music. My top 3 genres are:
1. Metal (Especially black metal)
2. Rap (Especially cloud rap)
3. Rock (Especially grunge and garage rock)  

My music isn't really business friendly, but I'll link the new website of my favourite band that's reforming later this year after splitting in 1998:  
[Jesus Loves Junkies Official Page](https://www.jesuslovesjunkies.com/)  
Come to think of it they're not very safe for work either but I just wanted to test out the link feature. ~~Maybe if I become good enough at this I can make them a half-decent website.~~

### Growth Mindset  
Having a growth mindset is very important when devloping skills and learning new things. Those with growth mindsets see challenges as opportunities and react positively to failures. I can keep myself in a growth mindset by:
1. Seeing failure not as the end but as one step closer to success
2. Staying positive and remembering I'm here to learn something new, so I'm likely to get confused sometimes
3. Looking back on how far I've already come from before the bootcamp
